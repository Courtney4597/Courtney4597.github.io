        <p class="description">
            In the spring of 2017 I graduated from MassArt where I majored in Illustration.<br> Since then I have been seeking opportunities to start my career as a tattoo artist.

        <p class="description2">
            Iâ€™ve always had a curiosity for tattooing. Both of parents had tattoos when I was <br>growing up, and I started my tattoo journey when I was 16 with a dream catcher <br>on my back. Since then I have added close to 30 others to the collection.
